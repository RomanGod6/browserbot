MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that allows an AI to test web applications by controlling a real browser, observing the page behavior, checking console logs, monitoring network requests, and verifying that everything works as expected. This is essentially automated end-to-end testing that the AI can use to validate its own web app creations.
